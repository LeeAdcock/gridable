*Gridable is an easy to use, in memory, infinitely scaled data grid. It is perfect for prototyping, exploring, and quick implementation in Python applications.* The library is written completely in Python, supporting 3.6+. 

In Gridable, data grids are made of cells that can be indexed along any number of dimensions. Each dimension can be referenced without limits, enabling the creation of very large grids without tedious initialization. Gridable is thread safe for multi-threaded applications and easily handles grids with tens to hundreds of thousands of cells.

Storing and retreiving values in the grid can be done through direct indexing, or through slices, arrays, and generators for efficient handling of very large datasets.

## Installation

The Gridable library can easily be installed with pip using `pip install gridable`.
